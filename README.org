My talk about how I got to understand reactive streams through C# and moved that
knowledge to ClojureScript.

** Story
*** C#
**** Long running problem with deployment/watchdog/heartbeat SW
***** Interprocess communication
***** Helper processes
***** Several KLs of code
***** Creator is on parental leave
**** Rewrite in same spirit, just leave out what is not needed anymore
***** Big chunks of code just copied
***** Same architectur
***** Programmer got ill
***** I took over and wanted to test it
**** New start with ReactiveX
***** Timer loop based checks
***** Subscribing to only right info through LINQ
***** Final aplications only couple of lines, mostly config
*** ClojureScript
**** potok
